I don't know why I love you like I do
After all the changes you put me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
I haven't seen the worst of it yet
I wanna know can you'll tell me
I love to stay
Take me to the river and wash me there
Won't you cleanse my soul and put my feet on the ground
Take me to the river right now
