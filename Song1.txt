I don't know why I love you like I do
After all the changes you put me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
I haven't seen the worst of it yet
I wanna know can you'll tell me
I love to stay
Take me to the river and wash me there
Won't you cleanse my soul and put my feet on the ground
Take me to the river right now
I don't know why you treat me so bad
Think of all the things we could have had
Love is an ocean that I can't forget
Sweet sixteen I would never regret
I wanna know can you'll tell me
I love to stay
Take me to the river and dip me down
Won't you cleanse my soul and put my feet on the ground
Take me toâ€¦
